I already had WSL2 installed for CS288, so I didn't need to do anything with that. I downloaded and installed Docker Desktop and performed some commands
to make sure it worked. I also watched some videos about using Docker to learn some of the basics. I have a range of text editors that I can use,
such as VSCode, Sublime Text, and Notepad++.
